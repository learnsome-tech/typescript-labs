# m06l02-02 · Unions

**Lesson:** [Union Utilities: Exclude, Extract, NonNullable And Awaited](https://learnsome.tech/learn/typescript-course/m06l02) (lesson 6.2, module 6: Advanced Type Programming And Utilities) · Pro  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can manipulate union types and unpack promise resolutions using Exclude, Extract, NonNullable, and Awaited.

## Files

- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/tsconfig.json`](starter/tsconfig.json)
- [`starter/unions.ts`](starter/unions.ts): the listing from the lesson
- [`expected.txt`](expected.txt): the output the check compares with
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m06l02/m06l02-02/starter`
2. Read `unions.ts`.
3. Run it: `node unions.ts`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m06l02-02`.

## Expected output

```text
Mutation allowed via POST
Resolved: enterprise
```

## How to check

`./check m06l02-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `node unions.ts` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output is compared line by line; spaces at the end of a line and blank lines at the end do not count. If that differs, standard output followed by standard error is compared with Python traceback frames and blank lines set aside, so a lesson that shows an error passes when your program prints the same error. A pass here is a pass on the site.
