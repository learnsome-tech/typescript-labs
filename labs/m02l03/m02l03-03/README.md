**Lesson:** [any Versus unknown: Defensive Typing In Practice](https://learnsome.tech/learn/typescript-course/m02l03) (lesson 2.3, module 2: Primitives, Literals And Top/Bottom Types) · Pro  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can distinguish between any and unknown, eliminate any-leakage from your applications, and safely parse untrusted external data using unknown with runtime type narrowing.

## Files

- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/tsconfig.json`](starter/tsconfig.json)
- [`starter/webhook.ts`](starter/webhook.ts): the listing from the lesson
- [`expected.txt`](expected.txt): the output the check compares with
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m02l03/m02l03-03/starter`
2. Read `webhook.ts`.
3. Run it: `node webhook.ts`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m02l03-03`.

## Expected output

```text
Validated event deployment.created with ID evt_404
```

## How to check

`./check m02l03-03` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `node webhook.ts` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output is compared line by line; spaces at the end of a line and blank lines at the end do not count. If that differs, standard output followed by standard error is compared with Python traceback frames and blank lines set aside, so a lesson that shows an error passes when your program prints the same error. A pass here is a pass on the site.
