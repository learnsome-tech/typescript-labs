**Lesson:** [void, undefined And null: Exact Optional Property Types](https://learnsome.tech/learn/typescript-course/m02l04) (lesson 2.4, module 2: Primitives, Literals And Top/Bottom Types) · Pro  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can correctly differentiate between void, undefined, and null in API schemas, and leverage exactOptionalPropertyTypes to separate omitted keys from explicit undefined values.

## Files

- [`starter/patcher.ts`](starter/patcher.ts): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/tsconfig.json`](starter/tsconfig.json)
- [`expected.txt`](expected.txt): the output the check compares with
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m02l04/m02l04-03/starter`
2. Read `patcher.ts`.
3. Run it: `node patcher.ts`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m02l04-03`.

## Expected output

```text
Untouched: Engineer, Cleared: null
Updated: Architect
```

## How to check

`./check m02l04-03` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `node patcher.ts` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output is compared line by line; spaces at the end of a line and blank lines at the end do not count. If that differs, standard output followed by standard error is compared with Python traceback frames and blank lines set aside, so a lesson that shows an error passes when your program prints the same error. A pass here is a pass on the site.
