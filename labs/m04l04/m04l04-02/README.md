**Lesson:** [Assertion Signatures: asserts condition And Invariants](https://learnsome.tech/learn/typescript-course/m04l04) (lesson 4.4, module 4: Type Narrowing And Control Flow) · Pro  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can implement assertion functions using asserts condition syntax to validate runtime invariants and narrow scopes without introducing nested conditional branches.

## Files

- [`starter/assert.ts`](starter/assert.ts): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/tsconfig.json`](starter/tsconfig.json)
- [`expected.txt`](expected.txt): the output the check compares with
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m04l04/m04l04-02/starter`
2. Read `assert.ts`.
3. Run it: `node assert.ts`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m04l04-02`.

## Expected output

```text
Processing order ORD_882
```

## How to check

`./check m04l04-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `node assert.ts` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output is compared line by line; spaces at the end of a line and blank lines at the end do not count. If that differs, standard output followed by standard error is compared with Python traceback frames and blank lines set aside, so a lesson that shows an error passes when your program prints the same error. A pass here is a pass on the site.
