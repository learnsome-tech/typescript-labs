# m06l05-02 · Event Listeners

**Lesson:** [Mapped Types, Key Remapping With as And Template Literals](https://learnsome.tech/learn/typescript-course/m06l05) (lesson 6.5, module 6: Advanced Type Programming And Utilities) · Pro  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can combine mapped types, key remapping with as, and template literal types to generate strongly typed event listeners and accessors.

## Files

- [`starter/event_listeners.ts`](starter/event_listeners.ts): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/tsconfig.json`](starter/tsconfig.json)
- [`expected.txt`](expected.txt): the output the check compares with
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m06l05/m06l05-02/starter`
2. Read `event_listeners.ts`.
3. Run it: `node event_listeners.ts`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m06l05-02`.

## Expected output

```text
Username updated to: octocat
Email updated to: octo@github.com
```

## How to check

`./check m06l05-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `node event_listeners.ts` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output is compared line by line; spaces at the end of a line and blank lines at the end do not count. If that differs, standard output followed by standard error is compared with Python traceback frames and blank lines set aside, so a lesson that shows an error passes when your program prints the same error. A pass here is a pass on the site.
