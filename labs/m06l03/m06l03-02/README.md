**Lesson:** [Function Utilities: ReturnType, Parameters And Constructor](https://learnsome.tech/learn/typescript-course/m06l03) (lesson 6.3, module 6: Advanced Type Programming And Utilities) · Pro  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can extract function parameters and return types to author type-safe middleware interceptors and metrics wrappers.

## Files

- [`starter/interceptor.ts`](starter/interceptor.ts): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/tsconfig.json`](starter/tsconfig.json)
- [`expected.txt`](expected.txt): the output the check compares with
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m06l03/m06l03-02/starter`
2. Read `interceptor.ts`.
3. Run it: `node interceptor.ts`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m06l03-02`.

## Expected output

```text
[order_svc] took 20ms
Processed order ord-77 with priority true
```

## How to check

`./check m06l03-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `node interceptor.ts` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output is compared line by line; spaces at the end of a line and blank lines at the end do not count. If that differs, standard output followed by standard error is compared with Python traceback frames and blank lines set aside, so a lesson that shows an error passes when your program prints the same error. A pass here is a pass on the site.
