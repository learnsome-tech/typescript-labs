**Lesson:** [Why TypeScript: Contracts, Erased Types And Soundness](https://learnsome.tech/learn/typescript-course/m01l01) (lesson 1.1, module 1: The Compiler And Mental Model) · Free  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can explain how TypeScript acts as a compile-time static type system, why types vanish at runtime through erasure, and how structural typing differs from nominal typing.

## Files

- [`starter/contract.ts`](starter/contract.ts): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/tsconfig.json`](starter/tsconfig.json)
- [`expected.txt`](expected.txt): the output the check compares with
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m01l01/m01l01-02/starter`
2. Read `contract.ts`.
3. Run it: `node contract.ts`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m01l01-02`.

## Expected output

```text
Sending welcome email to alex@example.com
```

## How to check

`./check m01l01-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `node contract.ts` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output is compared line by line; spaces at the end of a line and blank lines at the end do not count. If that differs, standard output followed by standard error is compared with Python traceback frames and blank lines set aside, so a lesson that shows an error passes when your program prints the same error. A pass here is a pass on the site.
