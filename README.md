# Production TypeScript

**Narrowing, Generics, Advanced Type Programming & Tooling**

7 modules, 35 lessons: The Compiler And Mental Model; Primitives, Literals And Top/Bottom Types; Object Shapes, Interfaces And Types; Type Narrowing And Control Flow; Generics And Parameterized Types; Advanced Type Programming And Utilities; Modules, Tooling And The OpenAPI Spine. Intermediate level, about 2 hours.

This repository holds the labs of the LearnSome.tech course [Production TypeScript](https://learnsome.tech/courses/typescript-course): each lab's starter files, a README with the goal, the steps and the expected output, and `./check`, which tests your work the way the site does.

## Start

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/learnsome-tech/typescript-labs?quickstart=1)

- **Codespaces:** the badge opens this repository in a dev container with Node.js 24.21.0, as in the site's lab sandbox.
- **On your machine:**

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/learnsome-tech/typescript-labs.git
  cd typescript-labs
  npm ci
  ./check m01l01-02
  ```

  You need Node.js for `./check`, and for the labs themselves Node.js 24.21.0. Other versions mostly work, but only the sandbox's versions are sure to print what the site prints. VS Code's Dev Containers extension builds the same container as Codespaces (x86-64).

## Doing a lab

1. Open the lesson on LearnSome.tech and the lab folder beside it: `labs/<lesson>/<lab>/`. The lab README has the goal, the steps and the expected output.
2. Work in the lab's `starter/` folder.
3. From the repository root, run `./check <lab>` (for example `./check m01l01-02`), or `./check <lesson>` for all labs of a lesson, or `./check --all`. `./check --list` shows every lab and how it is checked.

`./check` runs your starter the way the site's lab sandbox does: in a scratch copy that is its working directory and `HOME`, with `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, `input.txt` on standard input, 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream. It then compares the output with the site's own rules, so a pass here is a pass on the site.

| Check | What `./check` does | Labs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Graded | Runs the program and compares its output with `expected.txt`. | 33 |
| Runs, not graded | Runs the program and shows its output; the site gives no pass or fail, and the lab README says why. | 5 |
| Read along | Nothing to run here: the site shows the listing read-only, and the lab README says honestly what it needs (Docker, a cluster, a cloud account...). | 2 |

## What is published, and what is not

Every lab's starter is the code the lesson shows on screen, which is also what the lab editor on the site opens with. Where that code is the whole program, such as a recorded shell session or a script from the video, it is published as it is: it is the lesson content. Nothing beyond the lesson is published. There are no reference solutions and no answers to the lesson exercises, and nothing the site keeps private.

Pro lessons' labs are here as starters too. LearnSome.tech runs and grades your labs in its sandbox, hosts the videos and keeps your progress; running and grading a Pro lab on the site needs Pro.
